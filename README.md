- Real-time communication between the host and client machines.
- Proper message encoding, sending, decoding, and display in the rich text-box.
- Efficient server startup sequence to ensure smooth communication.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
- Socket Programming: For establishing network communication between host and client.
- Java Threads: For handling multiple connections and ensuring concurrent communication.
- Web Services: For handling the exchange of messages between users.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ).
3. Run the `ChatServer.java` class to start the server.
4. Run the `ChatClient.java` class to start the client application.
5. The client application will open a GUI where you can enter the server address and connect to the chat room.
